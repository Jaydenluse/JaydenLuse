<p align="center">
  <em>"theband.teaze" is a dynamic website I created for my band. At its core, Next.js powers the frontend, offering server-side rendering and static site generation within a React framework. The site's design is using Tailwind CSS allowing for more customized styling. On the backend, Express.js works in tandem with MongoDB, enabling efficient data management and retrieval. To ensure smooth deployment and consistent performance across various environments, I've containerized the entire application using Docker.</em>
